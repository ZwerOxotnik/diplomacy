## Overview

Adds advanced diplomacy system, diplomatic requests, needful commands, auto-diplomacy, customizable protection from theft of electricity and customized settings balance, etc etc.
Compatible with any PvP scenario. High performance.

I recommend using with mods: [secondary chat][secondary chat] as it is possible write to allies;
[Tiny pole][Tiny pole] if the protection from theft of electricity disabled;
Is it difficult to find enemy players? Use [Dirty talk][Dirty talk];
For balance evolution factor between teams [Soft evolution][Soft evolution];
For a custom "PvP" scenario [Pack scenarios][Pack scenarios].

## <a name="autodiplomacy"></a> Auto-diplomacy

forbidden_entity = (any turret, any wagon, locomotive, car, roboport, radar, rocket-silo)

If you mined entity.type = (forbidden_entity) **OR** entity.max_health >= settings.global["diplomacy-HP-forbidden-entity-on-mined"].value  another faction become enemy.

If you destroy entity.type = (forbidden_entity or player) **OR** entity.max_health >= settings.global["diplomacy-HP-forbidden-entity-on-killed"].value another faction become enemy, else neutral (if you are not already enemies).

If you damage to the entity.max_health >= settings.global["diplomacy-HP-forbidden-entity-on-damage"].value another faction become enemy with low probability.
